Warning

For testing and study purposes only, it is not intended as a guide for future investments.

Investments in crypto assets are very high risk.

Don't buy cryptocurrencies or assets if you don't have prior knowledge or because you've heard of high earnings. The gain is proportional to the risk.

This is not indicative, but if you happen to be interested in the subject and are willing to take risks, only invest what you are willing to lose, as there is a chance of losing the investment altogether.
